Physics body:
Transform - position, size & rotation
Collider type { BoundingBox, Triangle, Circle }
Velocity

Kinematic notes:
Rigidbody: Group of particles with a fixed distance between each particle, each particle has a relative rotation to the other particles.
Particle: A body of which we take no regard to the mass when calculating angular and linear position. 
Shared properties of both:
Position,
Velocity,
Acceleration

Velocity & Acceleration
v - vector quantity measured with the magnitude Speed
v = ds/dt <- instantenious velocity

Acceleration
a - vector quantity 
a = dv/dt

Relation between, displacment, velocity and accelration 
a = dv/dt = d^2s/dt^2

Constant Acceleration
Non-constant Acceleration
a = -kv^2
k - constant and the - sign indicates the acceleration is acting opposite of the objects velocity direction
this yields
a = dv/dt
-kv^2 = dv/dt
-k dt = dv/v^2
this would lead to
v dt = ds where v = v1 / (1 + v1 k t)
