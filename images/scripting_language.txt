VERY simple interface scripting language/system for manipulating entities 
inside Nano Game Engine

MUST:
move entities
destroy entities
callbacks for:
input & collision

EXAMPLE:
# This so we know which entity this "script" is talking about
using_entity = "triangle"

# This will be processed somehow into a series of statements inside C++
# The logic will be ran inside C++ not from file (speed & performance)
if input(KEYCODE) then move(x,y)
else (...)

Command String List:
move(x,y) -> moves entity

Logic:
System: ScriptingSystem
Objects: ScriptFile -> ScriptCommand
		    -> "Logic"ScriptCommand

ScriptFile{
    string scriptFileHndl
    -entity
    list<ScriptCommand> constantCommands

    void parseScriptString(string scriptString) (This gets called on  start)
    void executeScriptCommands() (This gets called atleast ones every frame)
}

ScriptCommand{
  -entity 
  -commandString
}

list<ScriptFile> 

void start() -> processScriptLogic() -> call parseScriptString(string scriptString) on every list<ScriptFile>, we supply the scriptString from here!

void update() -> processCommand() -> call executeScriptCommand on every list<ScriptFile> 

At startup/level go through each "script" inside resources\\scripts\\*.txt
Load script_name.txt
