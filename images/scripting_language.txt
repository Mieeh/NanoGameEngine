VERY simple interface scripting language/system for manipulating entities 
inside Nano Game Engine

MUST:
move entities
destroy entities
callbacks for:
input & collision

EXAMPLE:
# This so we know which entity this "script" is talking about
using_entity = "triangle"

# This will be processed somehow into a series of statements inside C++
# The logic will be ran inside C++ not from file (speed & performance)
if input(KEYCODE) then move(x,y)
else (...)

Command String List:
move(x,y) -> moves entity

Logic:
System: ScriptingSystem

ScriptCommand{
  -entity 
  -commandString
}

list<ScriptCommand> constantCommands
list<ScriptLogicBlock>
void start() -> processScriptLogic() -> if (..) -> insert into ScriptLogicBlock list
				     -> direct command -> insert into constantCommands list

void update() -> processCommand() -> process logic checks inside ScriptLogicBlock list 
				  -> runs every command inside constantCommands

At startup/level go through each "script" inside resources\\scripts\\*.txt
Load script_name.txt
